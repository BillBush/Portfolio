TradeOwl was a semester-long project I worked on with a classmate,
Jon Chapman, while a masters student at the University of South
Alabama School of Computing.  It was an online classifieds application
similar to cregslist but with geographic searches and trusted identity.
It impliments a Model-View-Controller architecture using the Symfony 2
framework.  TradeOwl is a work in progress.  The current developer build
can be accessed at dev.barteronlinewithlocals.com.
